				 <h2>Mercedes G63 AMG 2018</h2>
				 <p>With the new Mercedes-AMG G63, the Mercedes-AMG G-Class 
				 has undergone the greatest change in its history - while 
				 remaining true to its well-proven virtues. The G63 underpins
				 its unique position among performance off-road vehicles with
				 the powerful drive system, the newly developed AMG RIDE CONTROL
				 suspension, the AMG-specific transmission modes and the new 
				 interior with optimal widescreen cockpit. The basis for the hallmark
				 AMG Driving Performance both on and off metalled roads is provided by
				 the 430 kW (585 hp) 4.0-litre V8 biturbo engine, the rear-biased 
				 all-wheel drive (40:60) with three differential locks, the extremely
				 fast-shifting 9-speed automatic transmission, the double wishbone
				 independent front suspension and the adaptive adjustable damping.
				 The reinterpretation of the unmistakable design creates strong highlights
				 with the AMG-specific radiator grille, flared wheel arches, striking side
				 pipes on the exhaust system and the up to 22-inch wheels.</p>

				 <h2>New life, old style...</h2>
				 <p>"The new AMG G63 brings driving performance to the segment of 
				 unadulterated off-road vehicles in unexpected form. It was important
				 for us to tie in with the original character on account of the cult status
				 the G63 enjoys with our customers and fans. The vehicle has nevertheless 
				 reached a completely new dimension in terms of technology with the
				 4.0-litre V8 biturbo engine as well as in combination with the off-road 
				 characteristics, the agility and the vehicle dynamics achieved", explains
				 Tobias Moers, CEO of Mercedes-AMG GmbH. "This applies to the entire
				 G-C lass model series. Mercedes-AMG is responsible for their suspension
				 and chassis development as well as V8 competence."</p>

				 <h2>Gentlemen's choice</h2>
				 <p>The AMG 4.0-litre V8 biturbo engine now also replaces the previous
				 5.5-litre V8 biturbo engine in the G63. It generates 430 kW (585 hp)
				 in this model, and delivers a maximum torque of 850 Nm. This is available
				 across a wide rev range between 2.500 and 3.500 rpm, and provides a sense 
				 of effortless superiority. It absolves a sprint from zero to 100 km/h in 4.5
				 seconds. This dynamic performance is maintained up to the limited maximum
				 speed of 220 km/h, or 240 km/h with the AMG Driver's package.</p>
